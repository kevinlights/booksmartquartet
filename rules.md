# BookSmart Quartets rules and gameplay

In order to win, a player must collect 4 matching books. The book inventory of other players is visible to all, so we can make a guess on what color each is looking to acquire.

## Special abilities 

* Mirage: creates a mirage copy of a book (mage)
* Camouflage: a book presents as a different color (ranger/barbarian)
* Sneak: hide inventory from other players (rogue)

## Revised abilities

* Pickpocket, take a book from an opponent when in range (rogue)
* Stomp - stomping near an enemy causes them to drop a book (barbarian)
* Book Exchange - spell will exchange books from medium distance (mage)

## Inventory limit

The player inventory can hold 5 items. If a sixth item is acquired, the first is dropped.

## Players

Up to 4 players connect to a map to play. The first to collect 4 matching books wins.
Spawn points are fixed in the corners of the map.

## Maps

Maps should be sufficiently large that not all books can be acquired immediately. Books should be spawned at fixed spawn points on the map.

## More to be considered

It should be possible to load maps as an external resource using godot's DLC features.
Further, the game could take advantage of some fediverse infrastructure to find new user-contributed maps, such as searching
for posts with the #booksmartquartet hashtag with zip files attached.
