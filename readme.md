# Booksmart Quartets

Booksmart Quartets is a dungeon item-collecting game based on the old card game "Quartets" ("Kwartet" in Dutch).
The object is to collect 4 matching items before your opponent. Your opponent does not know which set of 4 you are collecting,
but they can make an educated guess and move to intercept items you need!

> This game is a submission to the Curdle Jam #21

## Hey! What's this Fediverse stuff?

The Fediverse is a network of individually hosted, federated services.
Examples of federated services:

* Mastodon, a social network akin to Twitter
* Matrix, a real-time chat protocol with various modern clients
* Peertube, to share videos

The "news from the fediverse" button you may have seen in the game searches federated Mastodon instances for a specific hashtag, #booksmartquartet

## So why complicate your life instead of just using Facebook, Twitter, etc?

Their goals and values do not align with my own. These corporations have proven time and again that they will do anything they can legally get away with to take advantage of their users, and users will accept it because they see no alternative. The Fediverse offers such an alternative: I can sign up at a mastodon instance that promotes open source software, freedom and privacy. And if I had not found one, I could have set one up myself. The same is true for all federated services. It is time we take the power away from those who abuse it, and bring real trust back into our online lives.
